# Chemfuser

Chemfuser is a deep generative model for molecular structure recovery using a diffusion-based architecture. It learns to reconstruct complete SMILES strings from partially masked sequences, enabling chemically valid molecule generation via denoising.

This project is implemented in PyTorch and is designed for flexibility, performance, and chemical validity during training.

> **Note:** This repository is an improved and extended version of [Chem_Fuser on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/kelu01/Chemfuser), developed by the same author.

## Project Layout and Directory Overview

The following directories and files contain the key components of the Chemfuser project:

- `model.py` – Core model implementation, including the transformer-based diffusion architecture and sampling logic.
- `vocab.py` – SMILES vocabulary management and tokenization functions.
- `train.py` – Main training script supporting both single-GPU and multi-GPU training using `DataParallel`.
- `train_amp.py` – Optional training script that uses Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) and `torch.compile()` for optimized performance on supported hardware.
- `data/` – Input resources:
  - `voc.txt` – Vocabulary tokens used for SMILES tokenization.
  - `canonical_smiles.txt` – Dataset of SMILES strings (one per line).
- `checkpoints/` – Directory where model weights are saved during training.
- `inference/` – Inference pipeline and related files:
  - `inference.ipynb` – Notebook for evaluating the trained model on masked SMILES.
  - `process.py` – Utility script for preparing input and running inference.
  - `test_set.txt`, `masked_test_set.txt`, `inference_data.csv` – Inference input and output files.
- `preprocessing/` – Scripts for preparing the dataset and vocabulary:
  - `create_dataset.py` – Processes raw SMILES into training-ready format.
  - `create_voc.py` – Builds the vocabulary file from the dataset.
- `LICENSE` – MIT license file.
- `README.md` – Project overview, usage guide, and documentation.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies required to run the project.
